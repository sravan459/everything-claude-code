# /add-new-agent-command

Use this workflow when working on **add-new-agent-command** in `everything-claude-code`.

## Goal

Adds a new agent command to the ECC bundle, documenting how to add a new agent.

## Common Files

- `.claude/commands/add-new-agent-command.md`

## Suggested Sequence

1. Understand the current state and failure mode before editing.
2. Make the smallest coherent change that satisfies the workflow goal.
3. Run the most relevant verification for touched files.
4. Summarize what changed and what still needs review.

## Typical Commit Signals

- Create or update '.claude/commands/add-new-agent-command.md' with instructions or definitions for the new agent command.

## Notes

- Treat this as a scaffold, not a hard-coded script.
- Update the command if the workflow evolves materially.
